Directory structure:

The package manager files live in /opt/FreePKG/
Specifically:
/opt/FreePKG/core/ contains the FreePKG core files
/opt/FreePKG/core/bin contains the FreePKG binary files (symlinked into /usr/bin)
/opt/FreePKG/tree/ contains the FreePKG package trees
/opt/FreePKG/etc/ contains the FreePKG configuration database


Tree structure:

The default tree is /opt/FreePKG/tree/master/ 
The structure is as follows:
/opt/FreePKG/tree/<treename>/<category>/<packagename>/

A package looks like the following:
For example, a package test in examples would look like this:

/
|
+-opt
  |
  +-FreePKG
    |
    +-core
    | |
    | +-stuff 
    |
    +-etc
    | |
    | +-stuff
    |
    +-tree
      |
      +-master
        |
        +-examples
          |
          +-test
            |
            +-pkginfo

pkginfo looks like this:
==BEGIN(not part of file)==
%PKGNAME
example/test
%END
%PKGDESC
This is an example (and test) package for the FreePKG package manager"
%END
%PKGLOC
LOCATION="https://github.com/testboi/examplepkg.tar.xz"
%END
%CHECKSUM

TRIVIAL
%END	#note: it could be {"MD5","<checksum here>"}. checksum is of the tarball.
%BINARIES
